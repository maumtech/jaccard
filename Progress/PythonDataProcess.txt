March 2020
Initially MySql was used.
It has speed issue and DB was corrupted.
Everything re started with Python.
First I created 'createSampleFiles.py' which I generated sample files
from thw source where OS sectors are removed.

Prof Jones wants to create samples from raw image file
by selecting random sectors upto given percent ( 5% for example) while discarding blank sectors.
so I  created 'createSampleFilesFromImages.py'
There are two versions of output, both do not contain blank sectors.
1. sample which contains OS sectors
2. sample which does not contain OS sectors

To DO
First, md5hash.txt of each OS has the following format :: C:/WinImage


d13e1de701f7234b1577fad1c3928edb  C:\Users\Myeong\Documents\Virtual Machines\Windows Vista bz 32\vista.img offset 0-511
bf619eac0cdf3f68d496ea9344137e8b  C:\Users\Myeong\Documents\Virtual Machines\Windows Vista bz 32\vista.img offset 512-1023
bf619eac0cdf3f68d496ea9344137e8b  C:\Users\Myeong\Documents\Virtual Machines\Windows Vista bz 32\vista.img offset 1024-1535

Need to create a OS.csv file of format
  <sectorHash,offset>  so we need only  ( lineVariables[0] + "\t" + count)
  which is second and third column.

Files under Md5Csv do not contain OS sectors and Blank Sectors.
Files under G:\M57\Md5CsvFull do not contain OS sectors and Blank Sectors.

Sample will be created from 'Md5CsvFull'.
But each sample will be compared with files under Md5Csv.
